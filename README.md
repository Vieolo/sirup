# sirup
Multi-repo workspace manager -- The closest thing to a monorepo without being a monorepo

## Install
`sirup` is a standalone binary

```
go install github.com/vieolo/sirup@latest
```

## Workspace
A sirup workspace is a folder that contains the `sirup.workspace.yaml` config file. It is recommended to create a standalone repo to hold a workspace.

Each workspace can have multiple independent repos, listed in the `sirup.workspace.yaml` which will be cloned in the given path in the workspace.

Here is the structure of the `sirup.workspace.yaml` file. I suggest avoid using whitespaces in the names.

```yaml
name: "workspace_name" # Name of the workspace -- Required
projects_path: "." # Where to clone the projects -- Optional. defaults: "."

repos: # The array of repos. Should have at least one repo -- Required
    - name: "repo_1" # Name of the repo. can be different than the actual repo name -- Required
      url: "https://github.com/to/your/repo_1" # URL of the repo -- Required
      path: "utils/repo_1" # Where to clone the repo inside the workspace -- Required
    - name: "repo_2"
      url: "https://github.com/to/your/repo_2"
      path: "cicd/repo_2"
```
